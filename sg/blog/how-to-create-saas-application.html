                    <p>However, in this case you do not have to download updates or work upon them.</p>
                    <p>SaaS is one of the cloud-based applications that holds a lot many advantages over premises
                        applications.</p>

                    <p>Software as a service offers you a wide range of benefits. However, beginning up with any service
                        you should be clear in your thoughts.</p>
                    <p>It is the way where your clients can come back to you and build a lasting relationship.</p>

                    <h5 class="mb-3 fw-bold">Choose A Technology Stack</h5>
                    <p>Technology stack is one of the prime concerns which needs to be taken. With it, you will not be
                        able to think to build SaaS.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, it is the prime requirement that experts take account into.</p>
                    <p>Here in simple words, the technology stack is the one that is used to build and run your app.
                        There are different tools you can consider and some of those are- HTML + CSS JavaScript
                        frameworks (Angular, React, Vue.js), JavaScript (Node.js) PHP (Laravel).
                    </p>
                    <p>In the case of building SaaS products MySQL,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL">
                            PostgreSQL</a>.
                        And the next requirement is for servers i.e., Nginx, Apache
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="mb-3 fw-bold">Select Your Pricing Strategy</h5>
                    <p>It is your pricing strategy that can make or break your web app. However, there is no such
                        specific pricing that SaaS has evolved.</p>
                    <p>But in this case, there are chances that your smartphone has a freemium app installed. In this
                        particular pricing model, an app offers a set of free core features.
                        You must walk with the pricing strategy which can help you to walk a long way.
                    </p>
