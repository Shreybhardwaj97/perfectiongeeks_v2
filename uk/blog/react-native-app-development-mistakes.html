                <p>Therefore it is very necessary to know what are some of those.</p>

                        Framework</span></h3>

                <h5 class="  mt-4   fw-bold">1. Picking Up The Wrong Redux Store Layout </h5>
                <p>Experts do look at design and processing when it comes to app development. But to some extent, they
                    tend to focus more on plan the design than processing.</p>
                <p>To this with the help of redux you can store data correctly and manage it. This will help to debug
                    the entire app state.</p>
                <p>When the overall process is planned properly then it is one of the valuable tools for data storage.
                </p>
                <p>If it does not happen then there can be a problem. However, it is the work of the <strong>React
                        Native App Developers </strong>that need to look at all aspects.</p>
                <p>Besides this, Redux is not suited for small projects of app development. It is because you need to
                    write a significant amount of code even if you have small changes.</p>
                <p>This is one of the reasons why you should go with react native for large applications.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-5"><span class="green-color">2. Modification State Within Render Function</span> </h3>
                <p>We all know that fact that data contains all the necessary information. On the other side, the
                    program collects and display the data.</p>
                <p>In the react-native, you can make use of the set state to take a new object and compare it to the
                    older one.</p>
                <p>Once you manage to perform the task the state will be added to the initial state.</p>
                <p>Also, there can be the case that appliances can display abnormal behaviour. This makes you create a
                    custom code than react.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, if you directly modify the state you will be able to get these fixes. </p>

                <h3 class="mt-5"><span class="green-color">3.Do Not Ignore External Modules</span> </h3>
                <p>External modules help to save a lot of time for developers. Along with this if you walk with
                    documentation then it will be easier for you.</p>
                <p>In some cases, modules can even break or in case they do not work. Therefore experts do have to
                    consider this step seriously.</p>
                <p>And they should take the practise of react-native.</p>
                <p>Also, this will help you to know why the module is not working or if there is any error and how can
                    it be fixe</p>


                <h3 class="mt-5"><span class="green-color">4.Wrong Estimates</span>  </h3>
                <p> It is better to get consulted for the layout. Here the <strong> React Native App Development
                        USA </strong> will help you.
                <p>As there are different plans for different platforms right from android to iOS.</p>
                <p>Compared to the other platform experts here do have to right more codes.</p>
                <p>Now when it comes to web applications you should own some reviews of several backend endpoints.
                    Experts here should hold the clear logic so that there can be an app build to perform better.</p>



                <h3 class="mt-5"><span class="green-color">5. Native Images Not Optimized</span>  </h3>
                <p>Image optimization with react native cannot be left. Here optimization will permit you the upload the
                    images on cloud storage.</p>
                <p>The cloud storage like S3 to get a CDN URL that can be returned via API.</p>
                <p>Applying this method can speed up optimizing the process of the images</p>
