                <p class="">Do you want to build a mobile app for your business? Then hire the Mobile Application
                    Development company to bring prospective customers to your website.</p>
                <p>The smartphone is playing a significant role in each one of our lives.</p>
                <p>We cannot deny the fact that they are a great source of our needs. We do not use the phone to just
                    make calls besides this it offers highly functional activities as well.</p>
                <p>While we are here to know about google play statistics and its trends. Therefore let us throw some
                    light at first on google play store.</p>
                <p>Now to one of the striking features which make them valuable to us is its APPS.</p>
                <p>It is the app that makes us personal to that professional life easier and fast.</p>
                <p>The world has gone mobile now, there are billions of apps introduced to those of working. Be it
                    android or iOS. </p>
                <p>It has been estimated that mobile app download has crossed around 218 billion.</p>
                <p>The main reason lies behind is the ease and comfort. Yes, the application has made work to be easier
                    and also effective.</p>
                <p>Almost everyone has a smartphone (teen, young, adults).</p>
                <p>Also, most of the users are found to spend around 50% of their day over phones. This is the main
                    reason the onset of mobile apps is increasing.</p>
                <p>This in turn has increased the demand for <a class="fw-bold green-color"

                <p></p>
                <h2 class=" blog-header-content mt-5 fw-bold">Competition Over App Store</h2>
                <p>There has been an increased level of competition to the app store.</p>
                <p>As there are thousands of applications released every single day. This says that more than 5 million
                    apps are combining two platforms.</p>
                <p>Yes, both android and iOS has millions of apps.</p>
                <p>When it comes to android it has around 2.8 million whereas iOS having around 2.2 million
                    applications.</p>
                <p>Users consider them and download them according to their requirements.</p>
                <p>Also, you can find different industries app so in this way, you will be able to reach your desired
                    service easier.</p>
                <p>As we mentioned that there are two platforms on which app can be built.</p>
                <p> • One is Android
                </p>
                <p> • The other is iOS.</p>
                <p>Each one of them has its own benefits features to those of specificity. It is up to you to which
                    platform are you in a need of.</p>
                <p>So before selecting any one of those you should know about them and their difference.</p>
                <p>Once you are aware of them it will be easier for you to select the platform for  mobile apps.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <h2 class=" blog-header-content mt-5 fw-bold">Difference Between Android And iOS App Development</h2>
                <p>You can be sometimes confused as to which platform is suitable for your business.</p>
                <p>No doubt when you have your plan you can connect with the  Best Android App
                    Development Company USA. </p>
                <p>They hold expertise in developing mobile apps for various industries. Upon reaching you will be able
                    to get all the relevant information.</p>
                <p>But besides this, you should also know what exactly the app development process is.</p>
                <p>
                    What is the major difference between android and iOS?
                </p>
                <p>Once you have a clear vision then you will be able to reach your destination more simply.</p>
                <p>Therefore we are here to let you some major differences between both of the platforms.</p>
                <p>They are not just differences in development but those of design and marketing prospects as well.</p>
                <h2 class=" blog-header-content mt-5 fw-bold">Difference In Development Process</h2>
                <p>The top difference between both of the platforms is in the technical process.</p>
                <p>They have different programming languages and testing processes. Let us begin to know what all are
                    they</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <h2 class=" blog-header-content mt-5 fw-bold">Programming Languages</h2>
                <p>Both Android and iOS use different stacks. Here iOS relies on <a class="fw-bold green-color"
                        href="https://www.perfectiongeeks.com/java-vs-kotlin"> Java or Kotlin and Android Swift..</a>
                </p>
                <p>Therefore experts here find iOS simpler in terms of development.</p>
                <p>Therefore based on the programming language you can decide whether you need Android or
                    iOS. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <h2 class=" blog-header-content mt-5 fw-bold"> Environment For Development</h2>
                <p>The second difference lies in the development environment which differs for both.</p>
                <p>Android developers make use of the android studio, one of the tools introduced by Google in 2013. It
                    has an expanded range of features that can be used.</p>
                <p>On the other side, it does hold an integrated development process with-</p>
                <p>
                    • Cross-platform support
                </p>
                <p> • High readability
                </p>
                <p> • A wide range of development
                </p>
                <p> • Debugging features.</p>
                <p>Whereas when it comes to iOS the developers rely on the XCode tool. The solutions help to offer
                    various bug fixing tools and help to support the entire range of iOS devices as well.</p>
                <h2 class=" blog-header-content mt-5 fw-bold"> Integrated Development Environment</h2>
                <p>Coming to make a difference between android and iOS can be quite difficult. Since both of them have
                    some pros and cons.</p>
                <p>The tool of android which is android studio helps to create multiple versions of your app.</p>
                <p>It also offers a flexible Gradle based system.</p>
                <p>Whereas when it comes to X code it has a decent editor source and assistant.</p>
                <p>Therefore experts ask you and also recommend all the pros and cons before beginning. Once you are ok
                    with all the terms and requirements the app development process will begin.</p>
                <h2 class=" blog-header-content mt-5 fw-bold"> Design Difference</h2>
                <p>Both of the platforms share the founding principles of software design.</p>
                <p>But they do not have 100% clicking precision. Therefore the smallest clickable areas are 44px for iOS
                    and 48px for Android.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h2 class=" blog-header-content mt-5 fw-bold">
                    • In the Case Of Android</h2>
                <p>In the case of android apps are built based on the partition, therefore the developers here have to
                    break down the app to fragment and activities.</p>
                <p>An activity that is relevant to the one app screen.</p>
                <p>Therefore if the developers have the project with multiple screens then he has to deal with multiple
                    activities.</p>
                <h2 class=" blog-header-content mt-5 fw-bold">
                    • In the Case Of iOS</h2>
                <p>The architecture of iOS relies on view controllers. Some of those are- page view, tab, split view
                    controllers.</p>
                <p>The benefit of the view controller is that it helps in managing the entire screen.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h2 class=" blog-header-content mt-5 fw-bold"> Development Complexity </h2>
                <p>When it comes to design complexity, android can here lose and has a lot to do with fragmentation</p>
                <p>On the other hand, apple releases a limited range of devices. There is several screen styles, density
                    and different version of OS.</p>
                <p>Therefore there are lot many such differences which you need to be aware of. Different Android or
                     Mobile App
                    Development companies USA  do let you know each one of those.
                </p>
                <p>But it is also your prime duty to be ensured about all of them.</p>
                <p>No doubt many companies around the world can offer app development services.</p>
                <p>But do find the one which suits your needs or can satisfy you. </p>
                <p>Now to such condition, you can think where to reach.</p>
                <p>If you have already been into app development then you can think of one company.</p>
                <p>But here is the case whether you got a satisfactory result or not? Therein some of them also find
                    other.</p>
                <p>Also if you are new to the business and want an app then also you do have to look for experts.</p>
                <p>Therefore in both of the cases, it is the role of experts who can help you.</p>
